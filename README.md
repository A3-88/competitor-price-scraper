# ðŸ¥ƒ Competitor Price Scraper

This project shows how I built a Python web scraper to collect product names, categories, links, and prices from an e-commerce site and transform them into a clean dataset ready for analysis.

# âš¡ What This Project Does
- Scrapes product info (name, category, price, link) across multiple pages.
- Cleans and structures the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Exports results to CSV for sharing or further analysis.
- Sets the foundation for competitor tracking, price monitoring, and market insights.
